When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	When more people are involved in the development of the project and need make changes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For bandwith saving? if Git's update frequency is hight and your bandwith has a low speed the update time may be long...
